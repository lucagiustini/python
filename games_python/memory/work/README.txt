Git hooks are scripts or programs that allow you to customize and automate certain actions or behaviors in Git. They are executed at specific points during Git's workflow, allowing you to perform custom actions before or after specific Git operations. Git hooks can be very useful for enforcing workflows, performing checks, and integrating with other tools.

There are two types of Git hooks: client-side hooks and server-side hooks.

Client-Side Hooks:
Client-side hooks run on your local machine when you interact with a Git repository. They are not version-controlled and are specific to your local clone of the repository. Client-side hooks help enforce development policies and prevent potentially harmful actions. However, they can be bypassed if users do not run them or modify them directly.

Some common client-side hooks include:

pre-commit: Runs before committing changes and can be used to perform pre-commit checks, like linting or code formatting.
prepare-commit-msg: Runs before Git prepares the commit message, allowing you to modify or pre-fill the commit message.
post-commit: Runs after a commit is made and can be used to trigger notifications or additional tasks.
Server-Side Hooks:
Server-side hooks run on the remote Git repository when certain actions are performed, such as receiving a git push. Server-side hooks are version-controlled, and their behavior affects all developers who interact with the remote repository. They are useful for enforcing policies across the team and performing pre-receive checks before accepting changes.

Some common server-side hooks include:

pre-receive: Runs before updates are accepted from the client, allowing you to perform checks on the incoming changes and decide whether to accept or reject them.
update: Similar to pre-receive, but runs for each branch being updated, allowing you to perform more granular checks based on the branch being pushed.
post-receive: Runs after all the refs have been updated on the server, allowing you to trigger actions after changes have been accepted.
To use a Git hook, you create an executable script in the .git/hooks directory of your Git repository (e.g., .git/hooks/pre-commit). The script can be written in any scripting language supported by your system (e.g., Bash, Python, Ruby).

Git hooks allow developers to automate various tasks and enforce best practices, making them a powerful tool for improving code quality, enforcing workflows, and integrating with CI/CD systems. However, it's essential to use hooks judiciously and ensure they are well-tested to avoid potential issues or performance problems.
